# WordFrequency
The code on here can be used to count the number of words in any given object (it maybe a web page, a text file and even in a book)


The given code here has been used to check the number of words, in a webpage of testimonials of a Python Resource Book. The list has been then sorted and packed into a dictionary with count of the number of words used.

The start() function is the webcrawler definition and can be modified to a file input/output operation if we want to import data from a text file or a book.
